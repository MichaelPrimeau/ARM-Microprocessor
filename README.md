# ARM-Microprocessor
This is a implementation of the ARMv4 instruction set. This design was implemented using VHDL and the Block Diagram Editor within Quartus Prime. This processor does not implement the entire instruction set but a simplified version.

The scp and system .bdf files contain the completed processor design.
